              The NE 130th Street Infill Station for Sound Transit’s Lynnwood
              Link Extension will add additional service to North Seattle
              residents once complete. Explore this site for information about
              the construction of station finishes, streetscape, and roadway
              improvements over the next two years. Learn more about what to
              expect as we prepare for the station to be open in mid-2026,
              connecting to service from Northgate to Lynnwood City Center
              Station that begins in Fall 2024.

              Our pre-construction open house event is for neighbors and
              community members to meet our team and ask questions. Learn more
              on this site about what to expect during construction, how to stay
              informed about the latest construction activities, and how to
              reach us. Can’t make it? Information on this site covers the major
              details. If you still have questions, please contact the

              In 2016 voters approved the addition of a light rail station to
              the Lynnwood Link Extension at NE 130th St by 2031. The new
              station will serve a growing residential neighborhood between the
              Northgate and Shoreline South/145th stations and would be built
              within the existing Lynnwood Link Extension line. Once complete in
              mid-2026 we estimate the NE 130th Street Infill Station will
              experience approximately 3,400 daily boardings with access to
              Westlake Station in 15 minutes and SeaTac/Airport Station in 53
              minutes.

                  In February 2020, the Sound Transit Board authorized staff to

                  The station design reflects the unique identity of this
                  neighborhood as an urban oasis, the community’s desire for a
                  modern design, and pride in nearby natural resources of
                  Thornton Creek. The design incorporates bright color and art,
                  seating areas, native landscaping, and natural elements such
                  as stormwater retention features and boulders. Renderings of
                  the final station design are included at the top of this
                  section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Sound Transit design team incorporated the feedback we
                  received in fall 2020 to the final station design. Community
                  members were asked to share their preferences for color,
                  seating, and bollards. The blue color preferred by the
                  community was used extensively throughout the station
                  finishes, associated specifically with points of vertical
                  circulation (stairs, elevators, and escalators). The seating
                  elements include both weathered boulders that reflect the
                  station design’s recognition of nearby Thornton Creek, as well
                  as shaped concrete benches located throughout the plaza areas.
                  The bollards are a modern stainless steel type with a sloped
                  top.

                  Artist Romson Bustillo, a Seattle-based artist, is developing
                  designs for the station artwork. Bustillo was born on the
                  island of Mindanao in the Philippines. His layered works and
                  immersive collaborations go back to his Philippine lineage,
                  his South Seattle/Pacific Northwest upbringing, and numerous
                  research travels. An artist selection panel made up of members
                  from the community and of art/design professionals were drawn
                  to the intricate detail in his prints and his
                  inter-disciplinary studio work, and chose Bustillo to create
                  artwork for the NE 130th Station based on his previous work
                  and his vision for the site.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The elevated station made Bustillo think of the dwellings in
                  his home country from his childhood, and he is developing an
                  iconography of patterns for the station walls. Bustillo’s
                  intention is to create an inviting work that conveys an
                  optimistic future, and that supports story-telling, encourages
                  discovery, and contributes to wayfinding. At the south
                  entrance, painted artwork will turn the guideway column into a
                  beacon that welcomes passengers as they approach the station.
                  Bustillo’s design narrative will guide passengers as they
                  enter and exit the station and make their way to the ticket
                  vending machines and to the platforms. His artwork will be
                  translated into richly colored, porcelain enamel panels that
                  wrap around the entrances and into both north and south
                  lobbies. The service building, in the center of the station,
                  will also house a 100-foot-long mural featuring his
                  visual-language inspired by the neighborhood.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Romson Bustillo will be presenting to the City’s of Seattle’s
                  Public Art Advisory Committee on October 23 to walk through
                  some updated renderings of the artwork that will be installed
                  over the station finishes at both North and South entrances,
                  as well as the central plaza artwork.
